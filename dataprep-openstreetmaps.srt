00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,000
the advent of big data and cloud computing 
means that we have enormous amounts of data  

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,800
at our disposal many of these rich data 
sets are available for free on the internet  

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,600
using cloud services such as google bigquery you 
can easily access data on all kinds of topics  

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,880
including things like weather demographics 
geospatial and medical data just to name a  

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,640
few in the past unlocking value from these 
data sets required you to have a high degree  

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,720
of skill in writing code or complex queries 
however with new tools like cloud data prep  

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,200
it is easier than ever before to wrangle this data 
and get the insights you need today's 10 minute  

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,760
challenge is to gather a list of restaurants 
pharmacies and banks in your neighborhood  

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,560
you must collect the names addresses and phone 
numbers of these amenities into a spreadsheet  

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,200
can you do it well the clock is ticking so let's 
go you can begin by following the github link in  

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,080
the video description below the first step is to 
go to openstreetmap.org open this up in a new tab

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
and here enter the address that 
you want to center the search on  

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
for this demo i'm going to type 
in times square in new york

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,120
and once you find the location click on 
it and select the little information icon  

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,000
this will reveal the latitude and longitude 
of the location copy this to your clipboard

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,160
go back to the github page 
and open up the spreadsheet  

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:56,240
make a copy of this spreadsheet into your 
google drive now go to clouddataprep.com  

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,560
if you are going here for the first time you 
will need to set up your google cloud project

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
once you are in the main user interface 
go to the flows pane and this is where  

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,440
we will import the flow the flow 
can be found on the github page

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:35,840
download this to your local machine 
and upload it into cloud data prep

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,480
add an output to the recipe and in the output 
options we will select a publishing action

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,840
add a publishing action for bigquery

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
choose the default schema

25
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
and create a new table this 
will be a parameterized table

26
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
and we will insert a parameter to represent the

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,160
we will have a variable to represent the 
amenity and we will give it a default value of

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:45,840
restaurant

29
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,080
you can now run a job for each amenity we 
begin with the first one which is restaurant  

30
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
you can specify the distance 
in meters from the center  

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:13,840
and also enter the latitude and longitude 
that we got from openstreetmaps earlier

32
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:27,840
and i'm also going to select the type of server in 
this case we will pick n1 standard 4 and run this

33
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,400
repeat this for each amenity 
so we did just restaurants  

34
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,840
the next one would be bank and pharmacy 
you can run multiple jobs in parallel

35
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,520
while the job is running in the background let 
me quickly show you what the flow looks like

36
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,160
it consists of a data set object which points to 
open street maps this is built off of a custom  

37
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,080
sql statement which has parameters built in for 
longitude latitude and distance in meters if  

38
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,880
you look at the recipe itself it has a few steps 
the first few steps actually convert the data to  

39
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,320
tabular format then it applies filters on the 
specific amenity that we enter as a parameter  

40
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,880
and then finally we format the column 
names and make it suitable for bigquery  

41
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,360
at this point all the jobs have finished 
executing you can go to google sheets  

42
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:51,840
and add a data connector for each of the 
tables in bigquery that you just created

43
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,920
if you followed all the steps you now have a 
handy spreadsheet with a list of restaurants  

44
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,920
banks and pharmacies near your home pretty useful 
if you ask me congratulations on completing the  

45
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,720
